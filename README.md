üî¢ Multi-Base Converter
This is a comprehensive number system converter application designed to facilitate easy and quick conversion between four fundamental number bases: Binary, Decimal, Octal, and Hexadecimal.

The application is built for simplicity and accuracy, providing a seamless experience for developers, students, and anyone needing quick base conversions across multiple platforms.

‚ú® Features
The converter supports bi-directional conversion among the following number systems:

Binary (Base 2)

Decimal (Base 10)

Octal (Base 8)

Hexadecimal (Base 16)

üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture
The application is structured into a straightforward two-part system:

Frontend UI: Provides a responsive interface with input fields for entering the number, a selection mechanism for choosing the source base, and a dedicated area to display the converted results.

Backend Logic: Contains the core conversion algorithms responsible for accurately handling the mathematics between Decimal, Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal representations.

Future Feature: An optional feature is planned to store and retrieve a user's history of conversions.

üöÄ How to Use (User Manual)
The application is designed to be intuitive and cross-platform.

Open the App: Launch the application on your desired platform (Web, Android, or iOS).

Enter Number: Input the number you wish to convert into the dedicated input box.

Select Base: Choose the current base of the number you just entered (e.g., if you entered FF, select Hexadecimal).

Convert: Press the Convert button.

View Results: The system automatically converts and displays the results in the required formats (Decimal, Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal).

üíª Technical Details & Code Example
The logic employs standard conversion techniques (e.g., repeated division for decimal-to-any base, positional notation for any base-to-decimal).

A Python implementation using the Flet framework illustrates the core cross-platform structure:

# CODE SNIPPET (PYTHON/FLET) EXAMPLE
# This is an example of the kind of architecture used for the application's logic.

import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    page.title = "Number Base Converter"

            radix = base_map[source_base]
            
            # Convert input string to decimal first
            decimal_value = int(input_value, radix)

            # Convert decimal to all other bases
            bin_result = bin(decimal_value)[2:]
            oct_result = oct(decimal_value)[2:]
            dec_result = str(decimal_value)
            hex_result = hex(decimal_value)[2:].upper()

                f"Hexadecimal: {hex_result}"
            )

        except ValueError:

‚úÖ Testing Plan
To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the conversions, a robust testing plan is implemented:

Unit Tests: Comprehensive unit tests are written for all core conversion functions to guarantee mathematical accuracy across all base transformations.

Manual Testing: The UI is manually tested across different devices and platforms to verify usability and the correct display of results.

üì¶ Deployment
The application is designed for wide accessibility and is deployed to multiple major platforms:

Web

Android (APK package)

iOS (IPA package)

Deployment is managed via GitHub, with installation verification performed on real devices to confirm functionality before final rollout.
