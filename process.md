## INTRODUCTION
Problem statement:  
Numbers are represented in different systems in digital electronics. Conversion between these systems manually is time consuming and error prone. For example, digital clocks convert binary data to decimal.  
This project aims to automate the conversion process by developing an application that can accurately convert numbers from one base to another.

## OBJECTIVES
- Design and implement a program that converts numbers between Decimal, Binary, Octal and Hexadecimal.  
- Automate the process to minimize human errors.  
- Create a user-friendly UI accessible on mobile (Android and iOS).  
- Deploy the final project and provide documentation for future reference.

## TOOLS USED
1. Programming language & framework: Python with Kivy  
2. Collaboration: GitHub  
3. Design tools: EdrawMax (for DFDs)  
4. Testing tools: Manual unit testing  
5. Documentation: Microsoft Word

## GROUP MEMBERS ROLES
1. ADRIAN MWANGI — Backend logic (conversion algorithms), Project Manager  
2. ANTONY KARIUKI — Deployment and Testing  
3. MARTIN NZIOKI — Frontend and User Interface Design  
4. CYLVIA AMDANY — System Design (flowcharts, diagrams)  
5. CARREN KOSKEI — Process Documentation and Program Documentation

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES
- A working application that converts between number systems.  
- A well-documented process and program.  
- A deployed version accessible on Android and iOS.  
- Collaboration proof (GitHub).
